Migration from lib-cove
=======================


This library is an updated version of the previous library ( https://github.com/OpenDataServices/lib-cove ).

However, the structure of the library and how it works have massive changes.
For this reason the upgrade path isn't a simple upgrade, but requires rewriting work in the software that uses this.

This is why this library is a separate git repository and a separate pypi package,
so that development of the previous library can also continue and users are not forced to upgrade before they are ready.
